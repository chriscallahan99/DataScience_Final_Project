This activity funds technical assistance to establish a fully operational and functional wine and vine register in Moldova to provide a reliable database for traceability data for grape growers and wine producers. This traceability system consists of a secure computerized database housing land ownership, farmer, grape variety, field size, and yield data.  Certifications are collected by professional staff of the National Agency for Rural Development (ACSA). The database will be available to government, farmer associations, and private sector organizations so that origin requirements can be verified to meet international export market requirements. Increased access to more lucrative international markets will result in higher prices for grapes and will result in higher incomes for all segments of the industry.  Further, by opening up new markets for Moldovan wines, the country's wine sector is more insulated from Russian economic aggression...The project involves direct coordination with a successful public private partnership including Moldova's Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, and the National Office of Vine and Wine.

For Moldovan wineries to be able to sell their products in Western markets, they need to meet stringent phytosanitary standards and be able to trace each bottle of wine to its source. This activity funds technical assistance to establish a fully operational and functional wine and vine register in Moldova to provide a reliable database for traceability data for grape growers and wine producers. This traceability system consists of a secure computerized database housing land ownership, farmer, grape variety, field size, and yield data.  Certifications are collected by professional staff of the National Agency for Rural Development (ACSA). The database will be available to government, farmer associations, and private sector organizations so that origin requirements can be verified to meet international export market requirements. Increased access to more lucrative international markets will result in higher prices for grapes and will result in higher incomes for all segments of the industry.  Further, by opening up new markets for Moldovan wines, the country's wine sector is more insulated from Russian economic aggression...The project involves direct coordination with a successful public private partnership including Moldova's Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, and the National Office of Vine and Wine.

For Moldovan wineries to be able to sell their products in Western markets, they need to meet stringent phytosanitary standards and be able to trace each bottle of wine to its source. This activity funds technical assistance to establish a fully operational and functional wine and vine register in Moldova to provide a reliable database for traceability data for grape growers and wine producers. This traceability system consists of a secure computerized database housing land ownership, farmer, grape variety, field size, and yield data.  Certifications are collected by professional staff of the National Agency for Rural Development (ACSA). The database will be available to government, farmer associations, and private sector organizations so that origin requirements can be verified to meet international export market requirements. Increased access to more lucrative international markets will result in higher prices for grapes and will result in higher incomes for all segments of the industry.  Further, by opening up new markets for Moldovan wines, the country's wine sector is more insulated from Russian economic aggression...The project involves direct coordination with a successful public private partnership including Moldova's Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, and the National Office of Vine and Wine. Helping wineries meet the more stringent international standards will help increase Moldova's trading relations with non-CIS countries and strengthen the private sector.",AID-117-A-17-00002,2017-10-01,2021-12-31,2,Obligations,2018,500000,516262

This activity funds technical assistance to establish a fully operational and functional wine and vine register in Moldova to provide a reliable database for traceability data for grape growers and wine producers. This traceability system consists of a secure computerized database housing land ownership, farmer, grape variety, field size, and yield data.  Certifications are collected by professional staff of the National Agency for Rural Development (ACSA). The database will be available to government, farmer associations, and private sector organizations so that origin requirements can be verified to meet international export market requirements. Increased access to more lucrative international markets will result in higher prices for grapes and will result in higher incomes for all segments of the industry.  Further, by opening up new markets for Moldovan wines, the country's wine sector is more insulated from Russian economic aggression...The project involves direct coordination with a successful public private partnership including Moldova's Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, and the National Office of Vine and Wine.
