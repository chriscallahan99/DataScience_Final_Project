To strengthen local systems and capacity, EH will provide training and support to private, non-governmental, and civil society organizations to provide quality services, focusing on both improved management and governance of services as well as improved capacity of health providers. EH will also support efforts to reduce financial and other barriers to care through community involvement, improved referral systems, quality improvement of MNCH service and adoption of healthy practices.

Specifically, the specific types and severity of direct and indirect impacts of (HEC) participants are experiencing across different landscapes and socio-economic groups will be assessed. Participant knowledge of and perceptions of elephant poaching-related activities (e.g., tusk and skin harvesting, storage and sale such products) occurring in the study area and across different socio-economic groups will be determined. An assessment will be made of how different types of HEC and poaching influences elephant conservation attitudes. Lessons learned will help the government develop more successful conservation plans and policies.

The program provides awareness-raising activities for youth and vulnerable populations to prevent human trafficking. Public awareness activities are a key component of the broader effort to counter trafficking in persons in Asia, and are carried out with partner governments, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and civil society. This initiative operates throughout Asia with the support of USAID, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and the international NGO WalkFree. The $8 million public -private collaboration has leveraged $100 million in contributions from other donors. USAID and AusAID are together awarding a new four-year, Phase IV of the MTV EXIT Asia campaign to raise awareness and prevent human trafficking. This $11 million agreement will establish a partnership in which USAID will contribute approximately $5.5 million to AusAID for MTV EXIT.
