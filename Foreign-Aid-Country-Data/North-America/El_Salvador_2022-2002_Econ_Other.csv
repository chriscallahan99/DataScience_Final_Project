In 2002, the grantee initiated the Monitoreo de Sobrevivencia Invernal (MoSI, Monitoring of Overwintering Survival) program, involving partners from 36 organizations across Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Through this program, partners assess habitat-specific information on the winter demography and physical condition of declining neotropical migratory birds, based on data they collect at over 50 mist-netting and bird-banding stations. Data suggest that long-term population trends of forest-inhabiting migratory birds are primarily driven by their winter survival rates. Partners will use their $139,624 grant and $1,406,519 in partner funds to expand the MoSI to 80 stations and continue collecting data on factors affecting population declines. Partners will use the data collected to date and during this project period to model the factors as functions of station-specific and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Results of the modeling and analysis, to be conducted in California, will then be used to formulate habitat-management strategies for wintering grounds. Grantee: The Institute for Bird Populations.

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest and in parts of Central America, oak habitats important to migratory birds are threatened by development, invasive plant species, and conversion to other land uses. Partners will use their $58,000 grant and $750,000 in partner funds to build on the habitat protection, restoration, and management objectives advanced in these regions in the projects first two phases. In California, Oregon, and Washington, partners will monitor oak-associated bird species and develop spatially explicit population and habitat objectives for the area. Additionally in Washington, partners will protect up to 300 acres of oak and pine-oak habitat, reintroduce 10 pairs of western bluebirds and conduct outreach about the effort, and control invasive species in up to 80 acres of oak forests. In Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, partners will continue to monitor oak-associated migratory bird populations, particularly the golden-cheeked warbler. Also in Guatemala, a Central American Pine-Oak Alliance Coordinator will be hired and partners will carry out reforestation and fire prevention and control activities in oak forests, as well as conduct community outreach. Additionally in Nicaragua and El Salvador, partners will hire and train four park guards to patrol two protected areas and to promote conservation within the community.
