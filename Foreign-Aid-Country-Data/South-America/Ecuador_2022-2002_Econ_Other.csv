This project addresses habitat loss in the Choc, a key stopover and overwintering site for Olive-sided Flycatcher, Canada Warbler and Cerulean Warbler. Partners will restore and protect the Ecuadorian Choc through four objectives. First, they will monitor 18,000 acres of wintering habitat including the Canand and Tesoro Escondido reserves and new transects surrounding them. These reserves will be patrolled continuously to prevent deforestation and hunting. Second, their monitoring allows them to identify critical areas for reserve expansion. Third, they will plant 30,000 native trees on ~247 acres on private properties and thereby improve NMB habitat quality and connectivity among remaining habitat patches. Finally, they will develop bird friendly income streams like carbon compensation and bird-friendly cacao production and build the capacities of local communities and stakeholders.",F21AP01677,,2023-06-30,2,Obligations,2021,199392,196059

At Ecuasal Saltlakes there is an ongoing program with three lines of action: ecosystem protection, environmental education and research and monitoring. Ecuasal company has implemented their Surveillance Plan to safeguard the borders of the saltlakes against intruders (artisanal fishermen, bathers, walkers). The company has increased daily patrols to the borders of the salt production plants preventing the presence of fishermen and bathers over weekends and holidays, and this phase will continue monitoring the implementation of a Surveillance Program to reduce shorebird disturbance.

The purpose of this project is to create the Jama Conservation Corridor spanning 69,189 acres in coastal Ecuador by supporting local, interested landowners with activities that will conserve and reforest parts of their land while encouraging sustainable livelihoods. This project will connect the last remnants of semi-deciduous tropical forests in coastal Ecuador through forest restoration, regeneration of abandoned cattle pastures, and groforestry, including silvopasture. Specific activities include: reforesting prioritized areas within the corridor; collecting baseline data for the flora and fauna in reforested areas; providing training to landowners in agroforestry; and facilitating educational outreach activities with local landowners, schools, and decision-makers on sustainable land use practices.",F18AP00850,,2019-09-30,2,Obligations,2018,49064,50660
