    "The US disburses the most foreign aid in the world ([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/ 'Foreign aid')) and it is of paramount impoartance that the countries who are in greatest need are able to get it. We examine US foreign aid disbursements to six countires of middle to low economic rank to determine the effect of monetary aid increases on five health indicators representative of overall health outcomes. The countries of Ethiopia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Haiti, Moldova, and Yemen represent a sample of countries exhibiting some of the greatest overall need for humanitarian aid. Geopolitical and environmental factors have rendered Ethiopia, Haiti, and Yemen dependent on foreign aid for humanitarian support. It is anecdotally acknowledged that overall increases in foreign aid disbursements would have a positive increase in overall welfare. We aim to determine which US Agencies have the greatest direct impact on improving health indicators. \n",

    "* If US agencies have a  budget set by Congress, how can they better utilize a limited budget with the maximum impact?\n",

    "Cereal production is vital to a country's self-sustainability and ability to feed its own without heavy reliance on foreign imports. Moreover, after careful examination of the dataset (see figure 2 for more details), many activity descriptions discuss improving food security. Many of the studied countries fall into the last places in the [Global Food Security Index](https://impact.economist.com/sustainability/project/food-security-index#rankings-and-trends 'Food Security Inded'). This fact makes domestic food production of prime importance for many of these countries. We look to examine if changes in aid donation affects the amount of cereal produced. We will only examine entries that contain certain indicators of food assistance. \n",
