    "The United States disburses the most foreign aid in the world ([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/ 'Foreign aid')) and it is of paramount impoartance that the countries who are in greatest need are able to get it. We examine US foreign aid disbursements to six countires of middle to low economic rank to determine the effect of monetary aid increases on five health indicators representative of overall health outcomes. The countries of Ethiopia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Haiti, Moldova, and Yemen represent a sample of countries exhibiting some of the greatest overall need for humanitarian aid. Geopolitical and environmental factors have rendered Ethiopia, Haiti, and Yemen dependent on foreign aid for humanitarian support. It is anecdotally acknowledged that overall increases in foreign aid disbursements would have a positive increase in overall welfare. We aim to determine which US Agencies have the greatest direct impact on improving health indicators. \n",
    "                \n",
    "Our analysis will explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How does US foreign aid impact different countries? \n",
    "* Does a \\$1 marginal dollar increase to one country increase health indicators more or less than different country? \n",
    "* If US agencies have a  budget set by Congress, how can they better utilize a limited budget with the maximum impact?\n",
    "* Is change in an indicator dependent on marginal dollar increases per agency?\n",
