    "The United States disburses the most foreign aid in the world ([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/foreign-aid-these-countries-are-the-most-generous/ 'Foreign aid')) and it is of paramount importance that the countries who are in greatest need are able to get it. We examine US foreign aid disbursements to six countires of middle to low economic rank to determine the effect of monetary aid increases on five health indicators representative of overall health outcomes. The countries of Ethiopia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Haiti, Moldova, and Yemen represent a sample of countries exhibiting some of the greatest overall need for humanitarian aid. Geopolitical and environmental factors have rendered Ethiopia, Haiti, and Yemen dependent on foreign aid for humanitarian support. It is anecdotally acknowledged that overall increases in foreign aid disbursements would have a positive increase in overall welfare. We aim to determine which US Agencies have the greatest direct impact on improving health indicators. \n",
    "                \n",
    "Our analysis will explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How does US foreign aid impact the overall health of different countries? \n",
    "* Does a \\$1 marginal dollar increase to one country increase health indicators more or less than different country? \n",
    "* Since US agencies have budgets set by Congress, how can they better utilize a limited budget with the maximum impact?\n",
    "* Is change in an indicator dependent on marginal dollar increases per agency?\n",

    "The countries chosen represent two distinct groups. One group that receives a vary large amount of foreign aid and one that receives less, but still a significant amount of aid. There is a noticable upward trend in Ethiopia and a peak in Haiti around 2010. The upward trend in Ethiopia is most likely due to a combination of drought, famine, civil unrest, and a civil war. Similarly, Yemen receives the a large amount of US aid in recent years due to the ourbreak of the Yemeni Civil War in late 2014, demarking the upward trend."
